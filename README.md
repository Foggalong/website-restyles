# Website Restyles

User scripts for restyling websites to my own liking.

1. Install a userscript manager browser add-on
    1. For Firefox get [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
    2. For Chrome get [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
2. Go into the styles folder and click on the script you want
3. Click the RAW button at the top right of the code
4. Follow the instructions and you're done \O/
